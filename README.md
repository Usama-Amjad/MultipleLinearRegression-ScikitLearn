# Multiple_Linear_Regression_with_ScikitLearn
In this project, we build and evaluate multiple linear regression models using Python. We used scikit-learn to calculate the regression, while using pandas for data management and seaborn for data visualization. The data for this project consists of the very popular Advertising dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through media such as TV, radio, and newspaper.
